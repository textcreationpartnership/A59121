            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O you, Sir, who have ſo well merited of the preſent Age, by the faithful and accurate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which you have given the World, of the Primitive Times, is this Addreſs preſented, as a juſt Tribute from one, who profeſſes himſelf a
<pb facs="tcp:43809:3"/>paſſionate admirer of the antient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages, and for that reaſon a moſt obedient Son of our holy Mother, the moſt Oxthodox, and pure, the beſt govern'd, and regular part of the Catholick Church; who having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to ingratiate him to the Wiſe and Learned, would make his Veneration for the oldeſt, <hi>i.</hi> the beſt Religion, a pretence for his intruſion; and I ſhould be unjuſt to that duty, in which all the lovers of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtory ſtand bound to your charity to the deſpiſed (becauſe ſeemingly antiquated) Rites of Chriſtianity, which you have with a manly courage, and much gallantry aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had I omitted this opportunity of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you know, how gratefully an unknown Diſciple of yours reliſhes ſuch inſtances of your generoſity and care in collecting and preſerving the ſcattered Reliques of the moſt reverend, and brave Aſſertors of the Chriſtian Doctrine. And when I once began to indulge to ſuch Sentiments, I was of a ſudden conquer'd by an inſatiable deſire of
<pb facs="tcp:43809:3"/>ſerving you; And though it may ſeem a debaſing of your worth, which I intend to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate, to intitle you to the Patronage of this Trifle, yet I was not willing to baffle my reſolutions, becauſe I knew, that the meaneſt Sacriſice aſſumes a luſtre from the piety of the <hi>Devoto;</hi> although here I ſhould have ſate down contented to have offer'd a poor and deſpicable Preſent on my private Altar, and never coveted the calling of the World to ſee ſo impertinent, and unbecoming an Oblation, had not the intereſts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion compell'd me to appear, when the more concern'd thought it not worth the while to ſtifle, and oppoſe an imperious Aggreſſor, who to promote the novelties of late days, takes Sanctuary in the remoteſt Antiquity, and would fain engage the beſt of Chriſtians, the Fathers, to protect and countenance him, who by his cloſe inſinuations, and clandeſtine practices, is ſo ready to put a Maſque on the Face of the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Truths, and in that odd dreſs render
<pb facs="tcp:43809:4"/>them ridiculous: while the Muſhroom-Opinions, that were the Birth of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or in former Ages branded as notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hereſies, muſt be recorded as the only Rule of Orthodoxy.</p>
            <p>Sir, my thoughts were ſome years ſince fixt on the <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity,</hi> and in the midſt of my Deſign I was happily ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded by your more ſucceſsful and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive induſtry; and I was not a little proud, that Mankind were reſcued from the impertinencies of my Scrible, and treated in a more ſatisfactory way in your exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and complete Collections, where the Heterodox and Obſtinate, the Factious and Schiſmatical may contemplate the Beauty, Order, and <hi>Decorum</hi> of the Temple-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; where the fierce and brutiſh, the uncharitable and cenſorious, may be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to the generous examples of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which is pure and peaceable; where the ill-natur'd and debauch'd, the luſtful and intemperate, may be invited to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb facs="tcp:43809:4"/>Scholars to that Eaſter, who teaches Men <hi>to deny ungodlineſs and carnal luſts, and to live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in the World.</hi> And had the Author of the <hi>View of Antiquity</hi> been ſo juſt to his own repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the intereſts of the Church, as he ought, he alſo might have found reaſon to ſtifle his deſign, and confine his Papers to his private Study, when your <hi>Apoſtolici</hi> beſpoke the Preſs; for his intentions were thereby foreſtall'd, and his Reader engaged to be ſevere, ſince after the delicacies of ſuch a Treat, as your Book affords, it were inſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Penance to be condemned to Bread and Water; although were there nothing but the coarſeneſs of the Fare to be apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiz'd for, it were eaſily pardonable, but when it is both mouldy and unſeaſonably ſerv'd in, it cannot but nauſeate.</p>
            <p>To reſcue therefore the ignorant and unwary, firſt engaged me to this making
<pb facs="tcp:43809:5"/>my ſelf publick, that ſuch little arts might not impoſe on the credulous, and whatever was ſo ſtiled, might not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently commence Antiquity; which Eſſay could poorly have pretended to the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of hopes of ſucceſs, had not your light directed me, and the account you give of the Apoſtles Diſciples in the three firſt Centuries unriddled many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure paſſages to me, ſo that this gives you a new title to my Productions, which if they may merit your pardon, and any way promote the veneration of thoſe beſt days, and practices, will over and above ſatisfie the expectations, and comport with the ambition of,</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF S. Ignatius.</head>
            <p n="1">I. GREAT and Eminent were the Virtues of the Primitive Worthies, and it were to be wiſh'd that their Fame in this Life were as diffuſive as their Glories in the other World, and Mankind made acquainted with the remarkable Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions of their moſt obliging Benefactors. But what a barren Account have we of thoſe Sacred Aſſertors of the Rites of Chriſtianity? Of ſome only their Names, of others not ſo much as that, Heaven having thought fit to inhance their Crown of Glory, to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the obſcurity of their ſecular Reputation, that though here they are bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Faces down-ward, and thrown
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43809:22"/>into the houſe of forgetfulneſs, they might be recompenc'd in the Reſurrection of the Juſt, when they ſhall ſhine like the Stars in the Firmament: And I wiſh I could as eaſily remedy, as I am inclinable to bemoan the Fate of the Church; that is, ſo to ſeek for the Catalogues of its ancient Biſhops; the Series of ſucceſſion, with reſpect to the names of the Prelates, being in moſt Sees wholly loſt, in the reſt very confuſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. Of ſome Fathers, their Writings are preſerved, but the account of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions loſt; of others, both Parent and Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring are involved in the ſame common Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity. How do I long for the Hiſtories of <hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> and <hi>Julius Africanus;</hi> for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologies of <hi>Ariſtides, Apollonius, Quadratus</hi> and <hi>Melito,</hi> and the Excellent Writings of <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> B. of <hi>Hierapolis?</hi> What ſatisfaction would it be to my Soul, to underſtand where <hi>Athenagoras, Minutius Foelix,</hi> and the other brave Defenders of Religion were born? What Teſtimonies of their Courage and Learning, their Virtue and Piety, they gave the World; and when and by what means they went into the Grave, that I might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Beauty of their Atchievments, and celebrate their Worth? I am eager to be acquainted with the Education and Life, the Speeches and Demeanour of <hi>Gordius</hi> and S. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> of <hi>Pionius</hi> and <hi>Germanicus,</hi> and the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Army of Martyrs; of <hi>Spiridion</hi> and <hi>Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi> and the reſt of the Holy College of Confeſſors; and would willingly read the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and ſolid Confutations of the ancient

Thus we ſee the Fathers are far from giving any honour peculiar to God to Saints or Martyrs, they living in an age, when the traditional account of thoſe things could not be eaſily interrupted, or the faith of men impoſed upon by fabulous and legendary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Reliques, which have been mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed after a prodigious manner by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the ſcandalizing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſober men of their own Communion. So that could I be aſcertained, where the Aſhes of S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> were really depoſited, I would reſpect and reverence them, and kneel down before his Tomb, and remember his courage and love to God, and thank my Saviour for ſo enabling him, and beg the ſame or the like aſſiſtances, for my ſelf; but before I ſhould worſhip his Head that is enſhrined in the Jeſuits College at <hi>Rome,</hi> or any of his Bones at <hi>Naples,</hi> or elſewhere reſerv'd, I

I will therefore ſpeak it boldly, that the bleſſed <hi>Ignatius</hi> had accurately imprinted all this Vertue on his Soul, being innocent and blameleſs, neither moroſe, nor angry, nor a Drunkard, nor a Quarreller, but without any love of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or love of Money, being juſt, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, temperate, and holding faſt the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful word of Doctrine; being watchful, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and modeſt, and Maſter of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vertues that S. <hi>Paul</hi> requires. And what proof of this ſay ſome? the ſame perſons that ſpoke theſe things ordained him; nor could thoſe that with ſo much
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43809:56"/>exactneſs adviſe others to make tryal of them that ſhould aſcend to the Epiſcopal Throne, themſelves perfunctorily do this act; for unleſs they had ſeen all theſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues planted in the Soul of this Martyr, they would never have ordain'd him to the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of this Dignity; for they certainly knew what danger threatned thoſe that made ſuch Ordinations ſlightly, and as it might happen. And this alſo doth the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> again ſhow, writing to the ſame <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> bidding him,

            <p n="3">III. In this I cannot but ſubſcribe to that Learned Man, whoſe name I reverence, but muſt take leave to profeſs my diſſent from him in another piece of Chronology, when he fixes the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s turning Montaniſt at the third or fourth year of the Emperor <hi>Caracalla,</hi> and yet affirms, that his Book <hi>De Corona</hi> was Writ the 7th year of <hi>Severus,</hi> at the Creating his eldeſt Son <hi>Antoninus</hi> his Co-partner in the Empire, and his youngeſt, <hi>Geta, Caeſar;</hi> for then we muſt grant <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s fall to have been very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it being very plain to me, that he was of that fond belief, when he writ the Tractate <hi>De Corona Militis,</hi> from theſe words, (
<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>De Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. c.</hi> 1.</note> with which he girds the Catholick Soldiers, who wore their Garlands on their heads, and thought it lawful to fly in time of Perſecution, which <hi>Montanus</hi> condemn'd, <hi>They may be well allowed to fly from Martyrdome, who have rejected the Prophecies of the Holy Spirit,</hi> Where he can mean no other perſon but <hi>Montanus:</hi> nor does he forbear on this account to rally the very Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:43809:131"/>words, <hi>I have known their Prelates Lyons in peace, but more timorous than Stags in times of difficulty.</hi> And in the
<note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 11.</note> ſame Book he makes it unlawful for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to be a Soldier, contrary to his former judgment in his Apologetick, where he tells the Emperor, That his Army was full of the Diſciples of Jeſus, and recites the famous undertaking of the <hi>Legio fulminatrix</hi> without blaming them. But the former paſſage of the Paraclete is ſo clear, that all that <hi>Pamelius</hi> can do in his Annotations, will not waſh the <hi>Aethiop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. I therefore think that the Book was Written, neither at the 7th nor the 16th year of <hi>Severus,</hi> as Learned Men diverſly opine; not in the 7th year, for <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Apologetick could not be Writ till that time, (there being no appearance of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, before that year of <hi>Severus</hi>) nor I think at leaſt till three or four years after, for
<note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Apologet. cap.</hi> 35.</note> in it he not only mentions the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Caſſius, Niger</hi> and <hi>Albinus,</hi> but of <hi>Plautianus,</hi> (as I ſuppoſe he means him in that Deſcription, <hi>Poſt vindemiam parricidarum racematio ſuperſtes,</hi> calling him the Gleanings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the full Vintage of the Traytors) whom he Characters, as a Man entring into the Palace Arm'd to the ruine of the Emperor, that he affected the aſſuming the <hi>Regalia</hi> in his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and Houſes, being moſt princely, and was not negligent in the conſultation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians concerning the Fate of the Empire, which are an exact Deſcription of that

               <hi>Spartianus:</hi> now the Treaſon of <hi>Plautianus</hi> did not break out till the 10th or 11th year of <hi>Severus.</hi> Nor do I think it writ in the 16th year of that Prince, becauſe
<note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> introduces that ſcrupulous, and over-nice man's Fellow-Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers complaining of him, as if that fact of his would incenſe the Emperor, and give occaſion to the raiſing of a Perſecution, that would put an end to their ſerene days and enjoyments; So that if it relate to the reign of <hi>Septimius,</hi> it muſt neceſſarily be referred to the beginning of it, when
<note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Id. ad Scapul. c.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 71.</note> having been cured of a deſperate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper by <hi>Proculus</hi> a Chriſtian, he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept his Miraculous Phyſician at Court with him, but ſhewed himſelf favourable to all perſons of his Religion; whereas about the 9th of his Empire, begun that fierce and cruel Perſecution, that ended not but with his Life. I would therefore preſume to believe, that the Donative, on the occaſion of which <hi>Tertullian</hi> writ the defence of that Soldier, who refus'd his crown, was given, not in the times of <hi>Severus,</hi> but in the firſt year of <hi>Caracalla,</hi> and <hi>Geta,</hi> on their return out of <hi>Britain,</hi> after the death of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther [when <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſlew all his Fathers Phyſicians for not haſtening his death, and his own Governor <hi>Euodus</hi> for endeavouring to take up the differences between him and his Brother, and all others that were favourites to <hi>Severus</hi>] it being uſual at the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43809:132"/>Inauguration of Princes to give ſuch largeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and very neceſſary at that time to ſmooth the mind of the Soldiery after ſo many bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh acts of cruelty, and continued threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of more miſchief.</p>
            <p n="5">V. So that I cannot but ſee a neceſſity of believing, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> became a follower of <hi>Montanus</hi> in the middle of the reign of <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> for in the fifteenth year of that Prince were his Books againſt <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> writ, as

            <p n="6">VI. To this Opinion, for the main, Mr. <hi>H. p.</hi> 13½. aſſents, but I can no way allow of his deduction from it; <hi>that therefore all the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and uſages of the Church (idle Ceremonies he calls them) which</hi> Tertullian <hi>reckons up in his</hi> de Corona, <hi>came out of the School of</hi> Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, <hi>as the</hi> Centuriſts, <hi>ſays he, profitably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and which,</hi> p. 169. <hi>he ſtiles the materials of the Antichriſtian Synagogue then preparing:</hi> For had <hi>Tertullian</hi> argued againſt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks from the obſervances of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle, he had expos'd his reaſonings to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, by begging the queſtion; whereas the Orthodox might eaſily retort on him, that theſe were not the uſages of the Chriſtian Church, but of their little Tribe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the method is perſwaſive, when diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the Catholicks, he urges them with their Traditional Rites and practices, which were common to both them, and the followers of <hi>Montanus:</hi> nor is it but a moſt irrational inference, to caſt off all things that are good, becauſe of the intermixture of ſome unſound Poſitions in any perſon or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; as if we muſt think all the accounts of the Primitive uſages in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> were only the little arts of the <hi>Arians,</hi> or in <hi>Socrates,</hi> did belong only to the <hi>Novatian</hi> Schiſm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one was ſuppoſed an <hi>Arian,</hi> and the other a <hi>Puritan:</hi> But to argue juſtly, we muſt firſt prove the Inſtitution of theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies

Nor know I how to decline the imputation of confidence and raſhneſs, who madly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe matters of the higheſt nature, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ordinary capacities with ſo ſmall a ſtock of Wit and preparation; for if we had, through the heat of Youth, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured on ſuch a deſign in another place, and before other perſons, could we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcap't the brand of boldneſs, and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit? but the undertaking is as raſh as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, to dare to do ſo in thy preſence, and madly to prophane thine ears with an undigeſted Harangue, and a dirty heap of impertinent terms, where only holy reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and divine Eſſays find entrance, not wrapt up in ſhadows and Aenigma's, and the coverture of obſcure words, but with the greateſt plainneſs and perſpicuity imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: It is time now therefore to grow wiſe, and by ending my Oration here, to ſet a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to my offence, which I earneſtly deſire; but having once treſpaſt on the borders of modeſty, ſuffer me, if the Crime may be

It is impious to be ſilent, when our powers cannot reach the Eminency of an equivalent retaliation, but an argument of candour and ingenuity, to aim at a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn we cannot attain to, and I will juſtly glory when I have done my utmoſt: This therefore ſhall be my gratulatory Oration, and a Specimen of my Reſentments, I dare not ſay a teſtimony of my thanks to God; for as it's his bounty alone that begins eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good thing in us, ſo it's our duty to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him the firſt-fruits of our praiſes, of our Hymns and Adorations. But ſhould I devote my ſelf wholly to my Maker, not as I have made my ſelf a wicked and impure Creature, but as he made me pure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; neither could I tender him any thing worthy ſo great a Governour, and prime Cauſe, whom neither particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſingly, nor the whole Series of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind conjoyned, if they entirely imploy'd themſelves in the ſervice, and amaſt all that was pure and acceptable, could ever cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate according to his merits; for even that power that enables a man to think and ſpeak well of his Law-giver, is alſo a free Emanation of his Creators Munificence, and he does not requite, but reſtore him his own.</p>

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:43809:164"/>good Genius, by a divine and wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, bringing me hither, contrived and perfected (and that queſtionleſs by deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the firſt hour of my birth) this bleſſed Union between us that were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and unknown each to other, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated at a great diſtance, as far as many intervening Nations, high Mountains, and deep Rivers could divide us. It would be too long accurately to deſcribe all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and particulars that gave birth to this familiarity; I ſhall therefore menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only ſome few of the moſt material paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages.</p>
                           <p n="1">I. My firſt education from my Birth was under the tuition of my Gentile Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, freedom from which erroneous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents I ſuppoſe no man could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, nor my ſelf hope, being as yet a child void of reaſon, and under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a ſuperſtitious Father; But not long after, my Father's death leaving me an Orphan, was perchance the firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable circumſtance that conduced to my acquaintance with the Truth; for then firſt I began to apply my mind to true and ſaving reaſon, I know not whether by the bent of my will, or any impulſive force; for what ſtrength of judgment could there be in a child of 14 years old? But then I began to attain the uſe of ſacred reaſon, as moſt men at that age uſe to do: Which paſſage, though I might heretofore, yet now I cannot look on as a mean effect of the holy and admirable providence of God
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:43809:165"/>towards me, that when I ſurvey the courſe of my affairs according to the ſeries of my years, all my actions that preceded this my puberty, though very erroneous, are to be attributed to my infancy and want of underſtanding; and that the ſacred di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates did not offer themſelves in vain to my ſoul before it was endowed with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but that as ſoon as it attained to the uſe of that faculty, though not in its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I began to be in love not only with humane, but Divine knowledge; while the ſacred learning by its own powers to me ineffable did aſſiſt the ſecular; which while I remember, my ſoul is tranſported both with joy and fear; being glad that I have made ſo good a progreſs, but dreading that after having attained ſo far, I may fail of my end. Thus I know not how have my words multiplyed beyond my deſign, while I am willing to give you an account of my firſt acquaintance with this admirable perſon, haſtening to a relation of what ſucceeded, not as if I intended to praiſe or requite him, that ſo bleſs'd me, but that I may afford you a plain and ſincere Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of my life and actions. My mother, on whom was devolved the whole care of my education, thought it fit, having paſt through thoſe other ſtudies, that become children well born, and brought up, to place me with a teacher of Rhetorick, that I might be an Orator, whoſe School we frequented, and were by competent judges thought likely to prove famous for elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:43809:165"/>but I had no mind to this ſort of employ, which wanted its charms to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear it unto me, but my Divine guide that was faithful in the tuition of his pupil, and inceſſantly watchful over me for good, when neither my Relations thought of it, nor my ſelf deſired it, ſuggeſted to one of my Inſtructors, who was appointed to teach me the Latine Tongue, a deſign to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to the ſtudy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, in which himſelf was no inconſiderable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; he undertook the task diligently, and I obey'd him rather to pleaſe him than my ſelf in a ſtudy which I fancied not. When he admitted me his Scholar, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted his notions to me with accuracy, and one thing which he told me I find ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, that the ſtudy of thoſe Laws would be of great advantage to me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I reſolv'd to be a Rhetorician and plead at the Bar, or would betake my ſelf to any other calling. Thus his Lectures tended to make me paſſionate of Secular Learning; but to me he ſeemed to be acted by a Diviner afflatus than himſelf was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of.

The Preſident of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken my Brother-in-law with him to this place to aſſiſt and eaſe him of his care in Governing the Province, for he was a Lawyer, engaged him in the journey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the company of his Wife, of whom he was not willing long to live depriv'd, and therefore ſent for her, and us to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny her, ſo that when I was meditating on travelling any other where rather than here, lo a Soldier with an Injunction, that my Siſter muſt go to her Husband, and that we ſhould take the ſame journey, out of complaiſance to our Brother-in-law, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to our Siſter, that ſhe might the more decently, and with the greater chearfulneſs undertake the journey, our kinred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading us, that it would be no mean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to the perfecting of our Studies, if we reſided at <hi>Berytus;</hi> all things conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to encline us, the gratifying our Siſter, and the convenience of our own inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beſides the eaſineſs of conveyance, the Soldier having brought more Carriages than were neceſſary for my Siſter alone.

Nor did I only admire, but infinitely love my ſage inſtructor, not with a light and deſultory, but with a ſtrong and invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affection, created in me by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and debonair carriage, by the reaſon and allurements of his diſcourſes; who ſought not to trepan but to enrich my ſoul with the treaſures of Philoſophy after the moſt dexterous, kind, and inſinuating me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that can be imagined; not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling into me thoſe notices which other men are capable of, but admitting me to a participation of thoſe peculiar bleſſings wherewith God had accompliſh'd him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other men, even his heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, which were Lectures of piety, that found many Auditors, but none whom they did not ſubdue and conquer to the love of holineſs: for who can reſiſt the eternal King? of whom when men are paſſionate, what is obſcure and unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:43809:168"/>it pleaſes; for there only it may be believed to be, where its powers diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their productions: So that what I have ſuffered is moſt plainly illuſtrated by theſe few words, <hi>the ſoul of</hi> Jonathan <hi>was knit with the ſoul of</hi> David, which can by no violence be diſunited againſt their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor with their own conſent, without difficulty; for the power to looſe thoſe bonds of this holy love was not conferred on the leſs eminent, and good of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe mind was various and mutable, as neither could he alone begin the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but in the firm and unſhaken good man, by whom alone this bond of amity could be truly knit; ſo that holy Writ tells us not that the ſoul of <hi>David</hi> was knit to the ſoul of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> but on the contrary, that the ſoul of the worſe perſon ſwayed by this paſſion, was united to the ſoul of <hi>David;</hi> for that which is better being ſelf-ſufficient, is not inclinable to a conjunction with what is worſe; but that which is worſe wanting the aſſiſtance of that which is better, ought to build its dependances thereon, that the more excellent part preſerving its ſtation, might ſuffer no detriment by its commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the inferior part, and that what was in it ſelf diſorderly, by this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might be overcome. So that to make ſuch a conqueſt, was the employment of the brave ſoul, while the duty of the meaner perſon was to ſubmit to thoſe pleaſing chains, ſo as not to be able to eſcape them. Such Triumphs hath this <hi>David</hi> gotten over
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:43809:169"/>me, and captivated me beyond the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of flying; and could I wander hence, yet the knot is indiſſoluble, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſacred Scripture hath ſo bound up our ſouls. His firſt undertaking was to beſiege me, till he compell'd me to conſent to my ſtay in this place, and then apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to cultivate me, as a skilful husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man does a waſte piece of ground untilled and unfruitful, ſtony and full of gravel, or rather as he manages a field not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther barren and unfit for fertile produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but of a fat mould, only neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and undreſs'd, and over-run with bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and thorns; or as an engraffer, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a wild but firm ſtock, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces four and harſh fruit, inoculates thereon better and more ſerviceable fruit, ſo as we often ſee the mixt tree made fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whereas before it was barren, and on a wild ſtock bearing excellent Olives, or the ſame tree, which before was wild made ſerviceable by the induſtrious Gardiner, or a tree otherwiſe naturally fertil, yet diſabled from bearing by too many ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by pruning made fit for fructification; ſo he not only looking ſuperficially on me, but ſearching me intimately, by queſtioning with me, and weighing my anſwers, did artificially harrow, plough, and water me, weeding out all the thorns and bryers, and all wild herbs and plants by reproofs and prohibitions, which my rude unſubdued and luxuriant mind brought forth; now ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying me after the <hi>Socratick</hi> way, anon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:43809:169"/>me by ſome other method of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, when he found me like a head-ſtrong and ungoverned Horſe, taking the Bit in my teeth, and running out of the way, till by his ſpeeches, wherein perſwaſions and violence were intermixt, he had made me tame and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive. This was uncouth and troubleſome at firſt, when I was unaccuſtomed to obey the Laws of Reaſon; but when he had thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to receive the Dictates of Truth, then he opportunely ſowed the Seeds, as in a free and well-ordered Soyl, obſerving fit ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for every part of this ſpiritual Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, heightning what was dull in my mind, either by nature or groſs diet, till it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd acumen, giving it an edge by his ſubtil diſcourſes of rational paſſions, and by this way awakening me out of my ſleep, my want of judgment, and my head-ſtrong ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtineſs either in aſſenting to the belief of what came firſt to my view, how falſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or reſiſting the truth, he chaſtiſed and corrected, by the ſame, and many other ſuch Eſſays: For this kind of Philoſophy is full of variety, inuring men neither to believe haſtily, nor diſſent obſtinately, but dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to examine all things, as well what is hidden, as manifeſt; for many Notions appearing to us Illuſtrious and Venerable, under ſpecious words, inſinuated themſelves a way by my ears into my belief, which I afterward found full of cheat and falſhood, and only dreſt in the Mask of Truth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me. On the contrary, many moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious Propoſitions wanting the <hi>Fucus</hi> of a
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:43809:170"/>plauſible Diſcourſe to ſet them off, ſeemed to me Paradoxes, and incredible, and were unworthily rejected and exploded, which appeared to be of Eternal Verity, when I weighed them more accurately, ſearching further than the Superficies into the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal nature of things. Thus was I taught to judge, and thus was I inſtructed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine rationally of words, not according to the little and unneceſſary Art of the <hi>Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> that ſay this word is Elegant, that Barbarous, but according to thoſe Rules that are moſt neceſſary for <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> for wiſe men and Idiots; in a word, for all men, ſince it is the intereſt of mankind ſtudiouſly to take care, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſcourſes they hear, they be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: Nor did he only rectifie this part of my mind, which <hi>Logick</hi> is deſigned to inform, but by an inſight into Nature and Phyſical Learning, did he excite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the lower faculties of my Soul, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the beautiful and admirable ſtructure of the World, the variety and the wiſdome of its contrivance, deſcribing and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing all things which are in the World, and clearly reducing them to their proper Claſſes, according to the Laws of Univerſal Nature, and their own peculiar tendencies, with all the Mutations that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in this great Fabrick. Thus by the clearneſs and reaſon of his diſcourſes, he baniſht that irrational aſtoniſhment that formerly poſſeſt me, and introduc't into my mind a rational admiration of the Oeconomy
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:43809:170"/> of the World, and the Products of Nature. This is that ſublime and Seraphick Learning which this moſt beloved part of Philoſophy doth teach; and what need had I reckon the ſacred Mathematicks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Geometry that all men affect, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy that makes its path among the Stars, which he taught me, making Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry the impregnable Baſis and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all other Sciences, but leading me higher by Aſtronomy, as it were by a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reaching unto Heaven, making me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that beautiful place, by the aſſiſtance of both theſe Sciences.</p>
                           <p>'But the principal deſign, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Tribe of Philoſophers ſpend their time and pains, is, that by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of all other Sciences, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtudy of Philoſophy, they might reap the fruits of their pains in an habit of holy and divine actions, whence iſſues the only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, quiet, and happy frame of mind. This was his chief task, that I might be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a Slave to my grief, or any other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that ariſe from fear of evil, but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, regular, and bleſſed, and truly like God. This he deſign'd in all his Lectures, full of mildneſs and learning, and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the modelling of my life and manners; and alſo by his actions did he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and ſway my impetuouſneſs, raiſing me to the contemplation and knowledge of the riſe and origin of thoſe heats and paſſions in the mind, from which conſiderations the Soul is inclined to a more regular demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:43809:171"/>that by viewing its own deformities, as in a Glaſs, it might be capacitated to diſcern the cauſes and roots of all evil, and that irrational Principle whence proceed all our hurries, perturbations, and abſurdities; and at the ſame time to ſee the reflections and beautiful lineaments of that brave Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that nobler part of the Soul, which as long as it preſerves its Empire, the mind lives free from the impoſitions of paſſions, and is ſecur'd from dangers; and when the Soul hath accurately ruminated on theſe things, it with eaſe rejects, and tramples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet, and deſtroys in their Infancy, all evil tendencies that ariſe from the more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble faculties, which either too much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Soul by intemperance, or ſtrangle and contract it by deſpair, that neither plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, nor extravagant longings, nor griefs, nor fears, may be able to diſcompoſe it; but it ſuckles and cheriſhes all that is good in us, which ariſes from our better part, till from the weakneſſes of Infant piety, it grows up to maturity, ſtrength, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for ſo divine Virtues are begotten in our minds: Thus we acquire prudence, which can exactly diſcern theſe motions and inclinations, by its judicious acquaintance with the paſſions themſelves, and all other external objects, whether good or evil; and thus we get Temperance, which in the beginning directs us to make wiſe choices, and Juſtice, which diſtributes according to every ones merit; and Fortitude, that guards and defends all the other Virtues.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:43809:171"/>He did not therefore feed me only with dry and jejune Lectures, of what was good or evil, what was fit to be done, or left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, as if that were prudence, for this is the emptieſt and moſt inſignificant of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, if the man's words and actions be ſtrangers; and that learning is vain, that doth not engage men to do their duties in the love of Virtue, and deteſtation of Vice; for no men truly know what theſe Virtues are, but they that practiſe them: For Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance is the knowledge of what is to be choſen, and what ſhunned by us, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philoſophers, eſpecially the <hi>Neote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,</hi> never ſolidly taught, who ſpeak big, and are very confident: ſo that I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently admired them, as if they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that Virtue that unites God and men, and given the World a Specimen, that nothing is ſo nearly a-kin to Heaven, as a wiſe man; when all this hath been only empty and inſignificant noyſe, while they neither taught true Prudence, by which a man might be engaged to act wiſely, nor true Temperance, that a man might imbrace and purſue the good things he had learnt, and as to Juſtice and Fortitude, they were perfect Strangers.</p>
                           <p>'My great Maſter did not ſo teach me Virtue, but his life was a more perſwaſive Lecture than his diſcourſes; his actions and his converſation were a more prevalent Charm than his words.</p>
                           <p>'I deſire all the Philoſophers whom I know, and of whom I have heard, and all other
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:43809:172"/>men, that they do not miſconſtrue me; for he wrongs me that thinks I ſpeak this as ſwayed by a paſſionate and ungrounded love to this tranſcendant man, or out of hatred of other Philoſophers, whom if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other man, I eſpecially will both praiſe for their pious and rational diſcourſes, and be delighted with the Eulogies which others give them; but what I now impeach them of is ſo publickly known, that the name and reputation of Philoſophy is thereby impaired; and I had rather, to ſpeak in ſhort, die an illiterate dunce and idiot, than to become a Proſelyte to ſuch unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming methods; for as ſoon as I was bleſt with this Maſter, I thought it, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps amiſs, beneath me for the remainder of my days, to conſult any other Oracle. Nor let this be cenſur'd as vain glory and affection to praiſe my inſtructor, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry the other profeſſors of wiſdom; but let them be aſſured that I cannot be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took for a flatterer, ſince my Encomium is infinitely below his deſerts: Nor did I ever hunt after words, and the ſmoothneſſes and ſpecious artifice of making commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory ſpeeches, being ſo much a friend to truth, when I was a child, and in the School of a Rhetorician, as not to praiſe that perſon or thing that did not deſerve it; much leſs can I now think it neceſſary when I intend to commend, to lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his honour on the ruines of other mens reputations; nor ſhould I but ſpeak evil and injuriouſly when I deſign to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:43809:172"/>ſhould I compare the holy and even tenor of his bleſſed life with the wandrings and extravagancies of others, I am not ſo mad to blaſpheme when I ſhould ſacrifice, but without any fucus, or the fetches of Oratory, I will give you a plain Hiſtory of what befell me. This was the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that firſt exhorted me to apply my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the Philoſophy of the Greeks, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading me by his manners to love and learn the Laws of a holy and juſt demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, when I had before-hand been proof againſt all the ſerious advices of other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, which I muſt confeſs fell out ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unhappily than by my choice, for I never heard many profeſſors, and thoſe few that I did, were only Philoſophers in their Words; but this man taught me to diſcourſe like a Philoſopher, when by allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me into a Philoſophick courſe of life, he had prevented the neceſſity of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; not only meditating before-hand what he ſhould ſpeak, but not thinking it fit to recommend to others, what he had not intended himſelf with a ſincere purpoſe and bent of mind to practiſe, ſtriving to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf as the Exemplar of that wiſe and upright man, whom his Speeches did deſcribe; but I will not call him ſuch a pattern, though ſhould I, it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a great truth, becauſe I promis'd not to entertain you with the ceremonious train and pomp of elegancies, but with the plain and naked truth; I call him not therefore an exact exemplar, but one that
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:43809:173"/>was infinitely deſirous to imitate ſuch a pattern herein chearfully, and with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and induſtry more than humane, employing himſelf, ſtudying to mold me into ſuch a ſhape, and frame, that I might not only be a competent auditor of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture concerning the paſſions, but might feel the benefit of his ſpeculations, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining all, or at leaſt part of every ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in my ſoul. By his private demeanor, he did as it were compell me to be juſt, and forcibly perſwade me to abandon cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, and variety of buſineſs, and the noiſe of the forum, to engage me to an acquaintance with my ſelf and my own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; for this is to live juſtly, and many of the Ancients did affirm this to be the only equity, intimating that a private life is more conductive to the ſelicity of our ſelves and others; for the great employ of this virtue, is to diſtribute to every one his due according to his merits; and what is more connatural to the ſoul, or ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming it, as to ſuperintend it ſelf? not to ſuffer it ſelf to wander, and do it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, by being concern'd in forreign af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but to be its own friend in converſing with, and enjoying its ſelf, and rendring it the care that it deſerves. Theſe were the rules of Juſtice, which he compell'd me to obſerve; thus he alſo taught me the moſt genuine prudence, not to be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at home, and to underſtand that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent precept, which the Oracle recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as a ſyſteme of Philoſophy to the

But beſides all other objects of his induſtry and diligence, I cannot enough celebrate him for his care in inſtructing me in the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:43809:174"/>of Theology, with what a skilful <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus</hi> he fitted me for the learning ſuch ſublime things, cautiouſly providing that I might run no hazards in ſo neceſſary a part of knowledge, as was the underſtanding of the prime cauſe; wherefore he indulged me ſo to follow my Philoſophick Studies, that I might read all ſorts of Philoſophers and Poets, and reject or nauſeate none of them (for as yet my judgment was not to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with chuſing or refuſing) except the writings of the Atheiſtical Tribe, who ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and affronting the common Notions and Principles of humane Nature, deny the being of a God, and Providence, whoſe Books were therefore unworthy to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, leſt my mind ſhould be debaucht, while intending to ſerve God ſeriouſly, it ſuffered it ſelf to be polluted with diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that oppoſe and deſtroy the ſervice of God; for they that pay their devotions at a Temple, are religiouſly curious, not to touch any thing that is profane: Such Books therefore muſt not be valued by men that put an eſtimate on Piety, but all other Books are ſo to be read, that we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prefer nor reject the writing for its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or ſtile, whether elegant or barbarous, but impartially hear all perſons. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wiſe and an accurate courſe, leſt one ſingle ſentence of this, or the other ſort of Sages being heard, and had in honour, might, being alone, under the ſhadow of truth, though in reality it were not ſo, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on our minds, and ſo captivate us, that
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:43809:175"/>it be not eaſie to relinquiſh it, or to waſh off the tincture: For the diſcourſes of men are a powerful, fit, and voluble Engine, dreſt up in the varieties of Sophiſms, and Arts of deceiving, that as ſoon as they ſtrike the Ears, ſuddenly make what impreſſions they pleaſe on the mind, perſwading thoſe who are thereby once ſubdued, to love ſuch Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, as the genuine and infallible Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of truth; and though there be no greater cheat than ſuch an Harangue, yet it ſettles it ſelf an Empire in the Soul; and, like a Jugler, acts uncontrolled by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and protection of the perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the mind being naturally prone to an eaſie aſſent, and to ſuffer it ſelf to be wheedled, and before it examines and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, either through its own dulneſs or weakneſs, or the ſubtilty of the diſcourſe, to yield its credence to the ſhadows and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of reaſon, and to erroneous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, which will enervate the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and not only ſo, but by a ſtrange kind of tyranny prejudice it againſt all talk that would undeceive it; for what elſe is it that introduc't ſuch variety of Opinions, and contrary <hi>dogmata</hi> among the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, while ſome ſo earneſtly defend their own, others oppoſe the Sentiments of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and a third ſort introduce new ones? and yet all profeſs themſelves Philoſophers, <hi>i. e.</hi> lovers and ſearchers after wiſdome; and that in their Diſputations they have the ſame intentions which they entertained, when they were firſt proſelyted to this courſe
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:43809:175"/>of life; nay, that now they are more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly in love with Philoſophy, now they have taſted the ſweets of it, than when at firſt their rudeneſs, and want of experience, depriv'd them of thoſe fruitions, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſtrong bent of mind made them its followers. This they confidently boaſt, and will credit no man that thinks other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for which reaſon we find none of the Antients undertaking to perſwade to be of his Opinion, any of the <hi>Neotericks,</hi> or <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks,</hi> nor on the contrary; for no man is eaſily induced to change an old, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to a new Opinion, though perhaps the <hi>dogma</hi> were the ſame, which he would eaſily have aſſented to, had he been perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it before he enter'd upon a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophick life, his mind not being yet preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd or foreſtalled, and ſo left free to love thoſe Sentiments in oppoſition to what he now believes. Thus the wiſe and egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly rational Sages of <hi>Greece</hi> turn'd Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, every one being acted by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtrong inclination, aſſerting the firſt Opinion that he met with as infallible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Doctrines of his fellow Sages as fallacies and trifles, while he is no better fitted to defend his own <hi>dogmata,</hi> than they are theirs; and yet neither force nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion ſhall make him of any other belief, having nothing to plead in his own vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but a certain irrational <hi>impetus,</hi> that ſways him to the profeſſion of this ſort of Philoſophy, as the only Syſteme of Truth; whereas this <hi>impetus</hi> is nothing but blind
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:43809:176"/>chance, that ingaged him to dote on what he firſt lighted on; and under theſe Chains he languiſhes, and is content with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, ſo he can catch but at the leaſt ſhadow of truth and demonſtration to countenance his own Aſſertions, and decry his Adverſaries, having unhappily antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated the convictions of his Intellect by a blind, raſh, and unweigh'd proſtrating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before an Opinion: But ſuch imaginary reaſonings, as they cheat men ſufficiently in other things, ſo moſt notoriouſly delude them in matters of the higheſt Cogniſance, the knowledge and ſervice of God; and yet here they remain intangl'd and fetter'd, as men that are ingag'd in the midſt of a large Quagmire, where it is impoſſible to go forward, or retreat, but the man muſt tarry till death deliver him; or a man in a high, thick, and ſpacious Wood, into which he entred with expectation of paſſing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, but finds every path leading him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the thickeſt part of it, wanders a while, but not being able to extricate himſelf, ſits down, and becomes an Inhabitant of the Foreſt; or like one in a Labyrinth, into which ſeeing but one way to enter, fancies his return eaſie; but when he hath paſt into the innermoſt part of it, and a while ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd the wonderful variety and wiſdome of the <hi>Apparatus,</hi> and the many pretty paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and is willing to return, finds himſelf loſt in thoſe Mazes, and his eſcape impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but there is no Labyrinth ſo full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible windings, nor Wood ſo thick,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:43809:176"/>nor Quagmire that ſo faſtens a man, as the perſwaſions of thoſe Philoſophers, if once they take poſſeſſion of the mind. But leſt that might befal me, that fatally afflicts ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he acquainted me not with one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Syſteme of Philoſophy, but led me through all the ſeveral Schools of thoſe <hi>Dogmatiſts,</hi> that I might be ignorant of none of their Opinions, but he ſtill went before me, guided, and led me, and demonſtrated to me what was Fallacy and Sophiſme, and meant to deceive, like an expert Maſter in the Art, to whom nothing happens unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, who ſtanding on the ſhore, reaches out his hand to ſave thoſe that are drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus among the Aſſertions of every Philoſopher, he ſelected and communicated to me whatever was veracious and uſeful, eſpecially what related to Piety, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all falſe poſitions. He adviſed me not to be curious and induſtrious in ſuch ſmall things, though I might, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, be reputed the wiſeſt of men; but that my chiefeſt converſe ſhould be with God, and his holy Prophets, while he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained whatever was obſcure and aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical in their writings, as many things are in the holy Scriptures; whether it were God's pleaſure ſo to talk with men, that the naked and plain truth might not be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the breaſt of an unworthy Soul, as many are; or that though all the Divine Oracles are in their own nature moſt perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and intelligible, yet are become difficult and dark to us, who have apoſtatiz'd from
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:43809:177"/>God, and forgotten our duty, I cannot tell. But he being a moſt acute and intelligent Auditor of God, illuſtrated all thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure paſſages, as if there were nothing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally unintelligible in thoſe writings to him, who alone, of all men that either I know or have heard of, by his conſtant Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations on thoſe pure and illuminating O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, is able to comprehend them in his own mind, and inſtil them into others. For that great Guardian and Governour of all men, who inſpired the Prophets, whom God loved, with their Predictions, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and divine diſcourſes, honour'd him ſo as to conſtitute him their peculiar Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, explaining by him what was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only in Parables to others, who being moſt faithful and veracious, either power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully commanded or demonſtrated thoſe things, beſtowing on this man the gift of Invention and Explanation, that if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were of a rough and incredulous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or elſe deſirous to be informed, being a Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <pb n="313" facs="tcp:43809:177"/>of Scripture are expounded, then what is ſhut is open'd; this excellent gift hath Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven beſtowed on this great Man to be God's Interpreter to the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> both to underſtand the Coeleſtial Oracles, as they are ſpoken, and to declare them to men, that they may know them: Therefore nothing was abſtruſe, hidden, or difficult to me, but I was fitted to dive into all things, and with all imaginable liberty, to ſearch and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all ſorts of Learning of the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> Myſtical or Politick, Divine or Humane, that I might ſatisfie my Soul with good things; which whether you will call it an ancient Leſſon of Truth, or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name, in him I did enjoy an admirable and full plenty of the moſt beautiful things. And that I may comprehend all in a few words, he was to me a Garden that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem'd Paradiſe, in which my employment was, not to cultivate this inferior earth, and to pamper my body, but to embelliſh and adorn my nobler part with the trueſt ſenſuality and voluptuouſneſs, like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beautiful trees either planted by my own induſtry, or by the hand of God: this was the Garden of true pleaſure, here did I indulge to my delights and genuine ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, with which for no ſmall time I was raviſh'd, which yet will appear to be very ſhort, if this day, when I muſt be gone from hence, ſhall put a period to my fruitions. For I know not whether my deſerts or misfortune enforce me to this departure or expulſion. I am unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:43809:178"/>with fit expreſſions to deſcribe my ſtate in, more than that I like another <hi>Adam</hi> am turn'd out of Paradiſe. How happily did I live under the inſtructions of ſo good a Maſter? and how ought I now to hold my peace? I then learn'd in ſilence, but is not this a prodigy, that the Maſter ſhould become a Pupil? but why ſhould I uſe theſe words? my duty and my intereſt oblige me to perſevere, not to deſert ſuch ſtudies: And is not this my crime an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that firſt tranſgreſſion? and do not the ſame puniſhments wait for me? am I not refractory and rebellious againſt the commandments of God, when I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in mine obedience? but becauſe I depart ſo, ſhunning this happy life, as the firſt man did the face of God, returning to the earth, out of which I was taken, duſt ſhall I eat all the days of my life, and be ſentenc'd to till that ground, that will produce nothing but bryars and thorns, that is, cares and griefs, and troubles and ſhame, and to return to the earth whence I came, to the houſe of my father, and my world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindred, deſerting that country which I would not apprehend to be the true place of my nativity; and thoſe relations, who were the greateſt friends of my ſoul, and my fathers houſe, where the parent is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd and honor'd by all his genuine ſons; but I unworthily and dirtily turn my eyes backward, and deſert my felicity. We read of a child,

Change but the Names, and the Hiſtory ſuits me; only with this difference, for I have not receiv'd my portion, but muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, leaving behind me all things that are good and dear to me, and changing for the worſt.

Without queſtion the Church was at that time melancholy, and clad in ſables, not ſo much for his loſs that was dying, as out of a deſire that they might not be robb'd of him, being always willing to enjoy the ſociety and preſence of ſo pious an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, ſo good a Prelate. But thoſe, whom the ſollicitude of his Encounter afflicted, were re-inſpirited with comfort, by the Crowns and Triumphs of his Victory; and now not only without any ſorrow, but with the moſt profuſe joy do we read and reflect on thoſe Tranſactions, and it is conceded to us to exult, not to fear in that day. For we do not fear that day that came with terrour, but expect the return of it with a ſerene chearfulneſs. It is pleaſing therefore with gladneſs to remember the Sufferings of that moſt faithful, couragious, and glorious Martyr, now the paſſion is paſt, for which then the Brethren were ſo concern'd when it was future. Firſt of all therefore, when he was baniſhed to <hi>Curubis</hi> for his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Faith of Chriſt, there was no
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:43809:202"/>injury done to the holy <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but much good to that City. For whither could he be ſent where that Saviour was not, for whoſe Teſtimony he was an Exile? Chriſt therefore, who ſaid, <hi>Behold I am with you always even to the end of the World,</hi> took care to preſerve that Member of his in all places, whitherſoever the Fury of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did drive him. O the fooliſh Infidelity of his Perſecutor! if thou would'ſt find out a place where to confine a Chriſtian, firſt find out, if thou canſt, a place whence Chriſt hath been driven; doſt thou think thou canſt force the man of God from his Country into a ſtrange Land, who being in Chriſt cannot be exil'd; and while he is in the fleſh is always a ſtranger? But now after what <hi>Cyprian</hi> did not think, but his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies imagined to be his Baniſhment, it is pleaſant to remember and conſider what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that his Exile, relating to his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. For when <hi>Cyprian,</hi> choſen by God, a holy Martyr, return'd from the City of <hi>Curubis,</hi> whither he had been baniſh'd by the Edict of <hi>Aſpaſius Paternus,</hi> the Proconſul, he took up his reſidence in his own Gardens; and thence every day hoped and expected that it would befall him, according as the Viſion inſtructed him. To what purpoſe now doth the rage of the Perſecutor expreſs its ſelf againſt a Soul always prepar'd, and eſpecially while it was confirm'd by a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from Heaven? How could God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert him in his Sufferings, who would not ſuffer him to be ſurpriz'd in his ignorance?
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:43809:203"/>in that therefore two were ſent unto him to introduce him to his paſſion, who took him up into their Chariot, and ſet him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, this alſo was an Admonition from above, that with joy he might recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that he belonged to the Body of that Saviour, who was numbred among the Tranſgreſſors; For Chriſt being Crucifyed between two Thieves, was expoſed an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of patience; and <hi>Cyprian</hi> being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in the Chariot to his paſſion, between two Officers, did walk in the ſteps of his Maſter. What an Eulogy does he deſerve, or rather what praiſes can be adequate to his merit, who when he was kept till the next day in the cuſtody of his Guard, and the whole multitude of Chriſtians were gathered together with Reſolutions to watch all night at the Door, commanded the Virgins to be circumſpectly look'd to? though his Body were in the Suburbs of the Grave, yet a Paſtoral Vigilance was lively and vigorous in the Soul of this Biſhop, who was wholly taken up with a ſtudious care and diligence to defend and preſerve the Lord's flock to his laſt moment. The hand of the cruel Executioner, that juſt hung over his head, did neither ſhake the Courage, nor ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede the Induſtry of this moſt faithful Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; he ſo thought upon his being a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr for the future, that he forgot not his being a Biſhop for the preſent; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more concern'd what account he ſhould render to the Prince of Biſhops, of the flock committed to his inſpection, than
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:43809:203"/>what he ſhould anſwer the Infidel Proconſul concerning his own faith; for he loved him that ſaid unto <hi>Peter, Loveſt thou me? Feed my Sheep.</hi> Nor did he omit to feed thoſe Sheep, for whom, even now, he made haſte, in imitation of him, to ſhed his Blood. He commanded the Virgins to be cautiouſly guarded, knowing, that he had not only a ſincere Maſter, but a cunnning and falſe Adverſary. In his Confeſſion, therefore, he arms the manly breaſt againſt the roaring Lyon, and ſhelters the female Sex againſt the Wolf that lies in wait to devour the flock: So that man truly conſults his own Intereſt, who is ſtill meditating on God as his Judge, before whom every one ſhall give an account of the managery of his life, and diſcharge of the duty enjoyned him, when every man ſhall receive, as teſtifies the Apoſtle, according to what he hath done in his body, whether good or evil. So he is his own beſt friend, who living by Faith, and haſtening that he may not be ſurpriz'd by the laſt day, doth reckon every day his laſt, and ſo perſeveres in doing what is pleaſing in the eyes of God, till the hour of his diſſolution. So the bleſſed <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that moſt compaſſionate Prelate, that moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Martyr adviſed himſelf to do; and not as the ſubtile Tongue of the Devil in the mouth of the wicked Judge admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd him, ſaying, <hi>Conſult thy own ſafety.</hi> For when the Proconſul ſaw his firm and unſhaken reſolution, when he ſaid unto him, the Emperors command thee to perform
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:43809:204"/>the accuſtomed ceremonies to the Gods and he anſwered <hi>I cannot do it:</hi> he ſubjoyn'd, <hi>Conſult thy own ſafety:</hi> That is the fly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating Tongue of the Devil, and though not of him that underſtood not what he ſaid, yet of him that ſpake in the mouth of the Proconſul. For the Governour ſpake not ſo much according to the mind of the Emperours, whoſe commands he boaſted, but according to the injunctions of the Prince of the power of the Air, of whom the Apoſtle ſays, that he works in the Children of Diſobedience. Whom <hi>Cyprian</hi> knew to work by the Tongue of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul, though he himſelf was ignorant of it. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> I ſay, knew when he heard him adviſing him to take care of his ſafety, that what fleſh and blood ſpoke fooliſhly, that Satan ſpoke craftily, and in the ſame body he beheld two perſons, one with his eyes, another with his faith. The one was unwilling he ſhould dye, the other, that he ſhould be crown'd with Martyrdom; at length arm'd with meekneſs towards the one, and caution towards the other, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly anſwers the Proconſul, and in ſecret overcomes Satan. <hi>Execute,</hi> ſays he, <hi>what thou art commanded; in ſo juſt an Affair there needs no Conſultation.</hi> For the Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul had ſaid, <hi>Conſult thy own ſafety;</hi> to which he anſwer'd, <hi>in ſo juſt a matter there is no need of Conſultation.</hi> For he conſuits, that either gives or asks Counſel; but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul was not willing to take advice from <hi>Cyprian,</hi> rather he admoniſh'd him to follow
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:43809:204"/>his Judgment; but the wiſe Prelate retorts, <hi>in ſo juſt a thing there needs no deliberation.</hi> I ask no Counſel, becauſe I am under no doubts; Juſtice it ſelf hath delivered me from all heſitation and ſuſpence. For the juſt man lives aſſuredly by his faith, that he may dye ſecurely in the Fleſh. Many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs were Harbingers and Fore-runners of the bleſt <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whom he had enflam'd to the conqueſt of Satan by many warm and paſſionate Exhortations; and it was but juſt, that he ſhould undauntedly follow thoſe by his ſufferings, whom by ſuch pathetical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives he had ſent before to Martyrdom. Therefore, <hi>in ſo juſt an Affair there needs no Conſultation.</hi> What then ſhall we ſay to theſe things, and by what Exultations ſhall we expreſs our joys? Into what form of words ſhall our hearts and mouths break forth, but into the laſt Speeches of that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Martyr? For when <hi>Galerius Maximus</hi> read his Sentence out of a Table-book, <hi>I determine that</hi> Thaſcius Cyprianus <hi>be behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> the good man anſwers, <hi>I heartily thank God.</hi> Let us therefore, being encourag'd in ſo momentous an Affair by the memory of this preſent place, by the Solemnity of this Feſtival, by the takingneſs of ſo perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive an example, from the bottom of our Souls, ſay alſo, <hi>The Lord be praiſed.</hi>

For his next Aſſertion, that God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons his Servants who ſin ignorantly, I look upon it to be very Orthodox, and agreeable to S. <hi>Paul;</hi> who, though in the whole ſeventh Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he had deſcribed the good man as one that with his fleſh did ſerve the Law of Sin, but with his
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:43809:209"/>mind the Law of God, beginneth the eighth Chapter with this comfortable Aſſertion, <hi>There is now no condemnation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus; i.</hi> ſuch ſins of ignorance and imperfection ſhall not damn them, if they walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit; when he both affirms and denies, that a man may be without ſin, he argues like S. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. where <hi>v.</hi> 12. he denies himſelf to be perfect, and <hi>v.</hi> 15. affirms it; but in divers ſenſes.

The Argument of <hi>Scultetus,</hi> muſtered <hi>p.</hi> 361. to the diſcarding that Tract of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> which contains, <hi>Teſtimonies out of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, of the Communion of the Divine Eſſence between the three perſons in the Trinity,</hi> becauſe many paſſages here, and in the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>ad Antiochum,</hi> are the ſame, and therefore theſe ſtoln thence, ſeems to me to evince the contrary, that that counterfeit Author took thoſe paſſages out of this genuine Treatiſe of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> that ſo he might be the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily entertain'd as the true Patriarch; and though Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> denys that the Epiſtle to <hi>Marcellinus, concerning the Interpretation of the Pſalms,</hi> and the Sermon <hi>of Virginity</hi> be his, yet S. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Authority weighs more with me, who entitles <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to two Books, one <hi>de Pſalmorum titulis,</hi> another <hi>de Virginitate.</hi> Nor is it but the moſt unconcluding of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the Homily <hi>de ſemente</hi> muſt be ſpurious, becauſe found only in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book.

                           <p>'TO praiſe <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> is to make a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick on Virtue; for when I name that admirable man, it is the ſame as if I celebrated Virtue; while a Conſtellation of thoſe beſt qualities did ſhine in him, or to ſpeak more truly, do ſtill exert their Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre; for all they that have lived according to the Laws of God, do ſtill live to God, although they have left this evil World. For which reaſon God is called, <hi>the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob, not the God of the dead, but of the living; and when I write an <hi>Encomium</hi> of Virtue, I ſhall magnifie God, whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native to the Sons of men Virtue is, that by that congenial light men may be led to the knowledge and embracing of himſelf. For whereas the largeſſes of Heaven are many and eminent, and beyond deſcription, the greateſt and moſt merciful of his Favours are the Inclinations which he works in us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf, and the Familiarity he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us with. For what the Sun is to ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Beings, that is God to rational Creatures, the one ſheds his Rays on the viſible, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:43809:231"/>illuſtrates the inviſible world; the one illuminates the eyes of the body, that it may ſee Heaven, the other the Opticks of the mind, that it may contemplate God. And as the Sun, whereas it confers on the eyes, and all things viſible, powers, that the one may ſee, the other be ſeen, while it ſelf is the moſt beautiful and accompliſh'd of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects; ſo God, as he gives power to underſtand, and a poſſibility of being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, is himſelf ſtill the chiefeſt and moſt perfect of Intellectual Beings, in whom all our deſires terminate, and above whom they cannot ſoare; for neither can the moſt Philoſophick, aſpiring, and curious Intellect aim at any thing more ſublime than God; for he is the choiceſt of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Beings, whom when men enjoy, their Speculations are at their height; for that man that breaks through his earthly Priſon by the aſſiſtance of reaſon and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſpelling all carnal Clouds and Miſts, can converſe with God, and be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the moſt illuſtrious light, as much as humane frailty is capable of, that man is happy, both in that he can aſcend to that glorious place, and alſo there enjoy that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Divine Nature, which true Philoſophy procures, and a mind exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this inferiour world to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Unity of the Trinity. But he whoſe Soul is debas'd by its Society with the Body, and is yet immers'd in Clay, ſo that it cannot look upon the Beauties of Truth, nor exalt it ſelf above earthly things,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:43809:232"/>though its Original were from Heaven, and its Native tendencies thither; that man is in my eſteem blind and miſerable, though bleſt with the affluence of Worldly Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and ſo much the more wretched, in that he is mock'd by his proſperity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded into the Opinion, that there can be any thing good beſides the chiefeſt and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good; gathering evil Fruit of an evil Sentiment, to be confined to darkneſs, to feel him as a conſuming Fire, whom he would not entertain as a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table light. This was the ſtudy only of a few of the former Ages, and the preſent <hi>ſaeculum,</hi> (for there are few Servants of God, though all are his Creatures) this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being courted by a ſmall company of Law-givers and Captains, Prieſts, Doctors, and the reſt of the Society of Spiritual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and among them by this venerable Patriarch, whom we now applaud. And who were thoſe brave Souls? that excellent man <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noe, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and the twelve Patriarchs, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Joſhua</hi> and the Judges, <hi>Samuel, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> for a while, <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and the Prophets both before the Captivity and after it, and thoſe laſt in order, but firſt in eminency, who lived about the time of Chriſt's Incarnation; that Torch, that preceeded the true light, that Voice that uſher'd in the Word, that Harbinger to the great Mediator of the Old and New Covenant, the Bleſſed <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and the Diſciples of Chriſt; they laſtly that after
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:43809:232"/>the Aſcenſion of Jeſus were Governours in the Church, or were conſpicuous by their Doctrine, or famous by Miracles, or perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Martyrdom: among theſe <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> challenges a place, ſome of whom he equalled, to others gave the precedence, and a third ſort, if my words be not too confident, he exceeded, imitating the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of one, the Actions of a ſecond, the Meekneſs of a third, and a fourth's Zeal, the Combats of another, many things in ſome, in others all; and in a third ſort ſome particular Virtue. As he that would limn an exquiſite Picture, firſt draws the ſeveral Features in his mind, and then tranſcribes them into the Table, which he deſigns a maſter-piece of Art; ſo did he take Tranſcripts of the Virtues of others, carrying away the palm from the greateſt Orators, by his perſwaſive Actions, and triumphing over the moſt active men in his Diſcourſes; or if you would ſo have it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling the moſt eloquent in his Harangues, and the moſt expert men in the Charms of Converſation, out-doing all that were but ordinarily furniſh'd with either of theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, in the tranſcendency of each pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar accompliſhment, and getting the ſtart of thoſe that were famous for one of theſe Embelliſhments, in that he was equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with every Grace: and if it were a brave and generous charity in thoſe that preceeded him to leave ſuch accurate pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of Virtue, is not he as admirable for his deſign, in affording poſterity ſo reverend
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:43809:233"/>an Exemplar? and perhaps to run through all the particulars of his life will exceed the limits of my time, and look rather like an Hiſtory than an Encomium; which out of compaſſion to Poſterity I could wiſh were done, as he hath written the Life of the divine <hi>Antonius,</hi> inſtructing the world in the Laws of a Monaſtick life, in the account he gives of that Saint's demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and when I ſhall have reckoned a few of the more ſignal of his excellencies, which my memory will ſupply, that I may gratifie my own inclinations, and comport with the deſign of the Feſtival, I will leave the reſt to thoſe that are better acquainted with his miraculous Atchievements. For it is neither juſt nor ſafe to honour the lives of wicked men with Monuments, and to bury in Oblivion the memories of the juſt, eſpecially in that City, which more than a few virtuous Examples can hardly reſcue from ruine, a City which makes all ſacred and divine Offices as ridiculous as the entertainments of Horſe-Races, or the Theatre.</p>
                           <p>'His early ſtudies were employed in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and holy knowledge, after ſome little acquaintance with humane, and liberal learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leſt he might be altogether an <hi>ignaro</hi> in thoſe things, which he reſolved to deſpiſe; for he could never endure to proſtitute, and debaſe his exalted and generous mind to impertinent trifles, and ſpend his time like an imprudent combatant, who buffets the air inſtead of his antagoniſt, and ſo loſes his
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:43809:233"/>crown; he was converſant above all men with the Old and New Teſtament, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with ſublime notions, and a beautiful converſation, faſtning the links, till they became one gold chain, a task too hard for ſome perſons, making his actions a guide to his contemplation, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation a ſeal to his actions. For the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom, it ſwaddles and ſuckles infant prudence, and prudence, when it hath out-gone the limits of fear, and attained to a genuine love, makes us the friends of God, and ſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſervants. Such was his education, and tutorage, as became one deſign'd a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Guide to the myſtical body of Chriſt, according to the great Counſel and foreknowledge of God, which long before lays the foundations of great deſigns; and at length is admitted to the Prieſthood, and made a member of the College, which make their approaches before God (that conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to meet and converſe with holy men) and is dignifyed with ſacred orders; and after he had paſt thorow all the inferior of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Eccleſiaſtick Miniſtration, that I may omit minuter circumſtances, is made Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which is the ſame, as if I had call'd him the Univerſal, or Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical Biſhop. Nor can I determine whether he took the Epiſcopal Office on him, as a reward of his virtue, or as a charitable act to confer life on the Church. For there was as urgent a neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing that Church, which was ready to
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:43809:234"/>periſh by ſpiritual thirſt, (the deſire of truth) as of the Angels bringing water to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> or of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s being chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſtreams of the brook <hi>Cherith,</hi> and reviving that expiring Prophet, that a holy ſeed might be left in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that we might not be left as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> whoſe crimes are notorious, but their puniſhment more famous, being deſtroyed by fire and brimſtone; for this reaſon is a horn of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation raiſed for us that were ruined, and a corner ſtone, that unites us both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and each other, is opportunely laid, or a fire is introduc'd, that purges all evil and putrified matter, or the husbandman's Vanne, whereby the chaffe of empty opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions is winnowed from the weighty and ſubſtantial truths, or the pruning Knife, which cuts off the roots of iniquity; thus in him the eternal word met with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender and aſſiſtant, and the holy ſpirit a ſervant, that breaths nothing but truth and piety: and on the conſideration of theſe endowments, by the joynt conſent of the whole people, not according to the evil cuſtome that afterwards crept into the Church, neither by murder and violence, but after the Apoſtolical way, and preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of the holy Ghoſt, is he exalted to the throne of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> who was as much his ſucceſſor in merit, as dignity, in time very remote from him, but in virtue, which is properly to be called Succeſſion, he came very near him. For they that profeſs the ſame faith, ſit in the ſame throne, but he

                           <p>'The days were when the Affairs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity thrived and flouriſh'd, when this ſuperfluous artificial way of Rhetoricating in matters of Divinity, was unknown, and a ſtranger, when the introducing of any Novel, or curious queſtion concerning God into the Church, was made a Crime equal to the admiſſion of a Stage-player into that ſacred place with his mimick and laſcivious Geſtures, or a Cheat to impoſe on the eyes of the Spectators by his agility and skill in ſhifting his Counters, when the honeſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of a plain and ingenuous Diſcourſe
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:43809:237"/>was accounted an infallible ſpecimen of a pious Soul. But after the <hi>Scepticks</hi> (the <hi>Sexti,</hi> and <hi>Pyrrho</hi>'s) and an itch of Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, like a deſperate and catching Diſeaſe crept into the Church, and a trifling humour was accounted ſolid learning, and what the Book of the Acts impeaches the <hi>Athenians</hi> of, was applicable to the Chriſtian World, that they had no leaſure for any thing, but to hear or talk News, what holy <hi>Jeremy</hi> can ſufficiently bemoan our confuſions, and horrid obſcurities, though he alone knew how to ſuit his Lamentations to ſo diſmal an occaſion?</p>
                           <p>'This furious and inſolent Aſſault on the Church was firſt made by <hi>Arius,</hi> whoſe name implies his madneſs, who ſuffered the juſt puniſhment of his petulant and ungovern'd Tongue, dying in an impure and ſtinking place, burſting aſunder like <hi>Judas,</hi> and being a Sufferer like that Traytor, as he had ſin'd like him, in betraying the eternal Word: but this did not affright others from court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame diſtemper, who methodiz'd and form'd it into an art of Impiety, who deny any thing of generation to appertain to the Divinity, and baniſh from it the very names of being begotten, or proceeding, honouring the Trinity only with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Divine name to all the three perſons, and hardly allowing them that. But this bleſt Soul, this zealous man of God, and great Trumpet of the Truth, thought not ſo; but foreſeeing that this leſſening of the Trinity into one perſon was a piece of
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:43809:237"/>the <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and Hereſie of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> who firſt invented this Scheme of contracting the Deity, and that the diſtinguiſhing and dividing the ſubſtance, was to make a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Divinity, he kept this courſe carefully to aſſert the Unity with reſpect to the Divinity, and piouſly to teach the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of perſons with reſpect to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, neither confounding the perſons by aſſerting the Unity, nor dividing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by aſſerting the Trinity, keeping himſelf ſtill within the limits of Piety, and ſhunning any extravagant inclinations to either ſide; and for this reaſon he in the holy Synod of <hi>Nice,</hi> in that Aſſembly of choice men, which the holy Ghoſt had there congregated, as much as in him lay, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the growth of this diſeaſe, when as yet he was no Biſhop, but one of their principal Aſſiſtants; for at that time Virtue made a man as honourable as a Dignity; but when this Spark was blown up into a great flame by the breath of Satan, and ſpread it ſelf far, (for here the Tragedy began, that hath ſince fill'd the World) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and various Engines were employed to ruine this great Aſſertor, this generous Champion of Jeſus; (for the ſtrongeſt Souldiers are made Aggreſſors of him, that moſt couragiouſly reſiſts) and on every ſide dangers flow in upon him, (for wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs is very inventive of miſchief, and daring in its aſſaults; for how could it be expected that they ſhould be favourable to men that durſt abuſe their God?) but there
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:43809:238"/>was one effect of their animoſity that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the moſt violent Conſequences, for I my ſelf ſhall contribute a few materials to the compleating the <hi>Drama.</hi> But here my Country, the beloved place of my Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, merits pardon; for the Crime is not imputable to the place, but to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; for <hi>Cappadocia</hi> is every where famous for Holineſs and Religion, but theſe men are unworthy the name of Sons of the Church; but ye have heard, that a Bramble grows at the root of a Vine, and that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> the Traytor was one of the Diſciples; nor are there wanting, that affirm, that a Nameſake of mine was not altogether inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in this Affair, who being at that time reſident at <hi>Alexandria</hi> on the account of his ſtudies, and treated with as much kindneſs by this Patriarch, as if he had been his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Son, in as much as he was one to whom he intruſted his greateſt concerns, he, as it is reported, takes up reſolutions of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Father and Benefactor. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others were the Authors of the Tragedy, yet men ſay, that the hand of <hi>Abſolom</hi> was with them; if any of you remember that hand, with the cutting off of which this Saint was belyed, or the dead man, yet liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whom he was ſaid to murder, or his unjuſt baniſhment, he underſtands what I ſay. But this I willingly forget, for this is my judgment in dubious things, to be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to a charitable conſtruction, and rather to abſolve than condemn a Criminal.

<pb n="435" facs="tcp:43809:238"/>the innocent, but the good not ſo apt to cenſure the Villain; for he that is not vicious is not ſuſpicious of others; but what I now ſpeak of is not rumour, but palpable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not a bare ſuſpicion, but a firm and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick perſwaſion. A <hi>Cappadocian</hi> Monſtre, born in the utmoſt Borders of our Country, of a ſcandalous Family, and a worſe mind, no Freeman born, but of a mixt Generation, as Mules are; at firſt a Servant at another mans Table, a Wretch, that might be hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a Cruſt of Bread, inclinable to ſay or do any thing to fill his Belly, afterward, when he perniciouſly intruded himſelf into employment in the Common-wealth, he was intruſted with the mean and moſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Office of a Sutler, to ſupply the Army with Swines fleſh; in which when he had broken his truſt, (ſacrificing all things to his own Belly) and had nothing left him but himſelf, he bethinks him of running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and ſhifting from one Country and City to another, (as Vagrants do) at laſt to the ruine of the Churches Intereſts, like one of the Plagues of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he wanders into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> here he ends his Exile, and begins miſchief, being eminent in nothing elſe, neither for his learning, nor accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pleaſant Converſe, much leſs for putting on the Mask of Piety and Religion, but fitted for all ſort of Villany and Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances. Ye all know what Tumults he raiſed againſt this Saint, for the Righteous are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times delivered into the hand of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, not to create honour to the Wicked,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:43809:239"/>but to experiment the courage of the good man, that the Sinner may dye an evil and unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual death, as the Scripture aſſures us, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men are in this life derided, as long as God hides his Countenance, while there are laid up great Treaſures for both againſt thoſe future days, when every Word, Deed and Thought ſhall be weighed in the juſt Balance of God, when he ſhall ariſe to judge the Earth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting mens Deſigns and Actions, and detecting thoſe ſecrets which have been laid up and ſealed in Heaven. This both the the Sufferings and the Diſcourſes of <hi>Job</hi> may perſwade us, who was a great lover of truth, a man unblameable, juſt, and pious, and Maſter of many other Virtues, as holy Writ teſtifies: and yet was he aſſaulted with ſuch various and cruel Inſtruments of Satan's Malice that had begg'd liberty to plague him, that of all the men which ſince the beginning of the World have fallen into Adverſity, and many as it is probable into Torments and Vexations, no man yet can compare Sufferings with him; for he loſt not only his Wealth and Cattel, a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and numerous progeny, which all men earneſtly covet, and that in ſo ſhort a ſpace that there was no more left for his ſorrows to interpoſe between his laſt and the next Afflictions, but in the end was ſmitten in his body with an uncurable &amp; frightful diſeaſe, and to make his griefs inſufferable, muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the bitter and wretched Conſolations of his Wife, whoſe great buſineſs it was to wound his Soul proportionable to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:43809:239"/>of his Body; moreover his beſt Friends were, as he ſays, miſerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters, who when they ſaw his griefs, but underſtood not the myſtery of Providence, thought his puniſhment not a Tryal of his Virtue, but Vengeance on his Crimes, and this they not only thought, but never bluſh'd openly and ſeverely to reprove him for it' and that ſo unſeaſonably, that had he been plagued for his Offences, there was more need to ſmooth and alleviate his ſadneſſes by comfortable Diſcourſes: In this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was <hi>Job,</hi> and theſe were ſome of the firſt Diſpenſations of Providence towards him, there was a Combate between Virtue, and Envy; the evil ſpirit ſtriving to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all that was good in him, and his Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty exerting it ſelf to preſerve its Rights inviolable; Satan endeavouring to ſmooth the way to Vice by the puniſhments of the juſt Virtue, that its Followers might retain their Integrity, and triumph over their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. But what all this while did he, that gave him Oracles from the whirl-wind and the Clouds, who is ſlow to wrath, but earneſt to be compaſſionate, who does not ſuffer the rod of the Wicked always to reſt on the lot of the Righteous, leſt the Righteous learn Iniquity? In the end of his Engagements God with a loud Voice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces him a Conquerour, and diſcloſes the Myſtery of his Chaſtiſement. <hi>Thinkeſt thou, O my Servant, that I had any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions than that thy Righteouſneſs ſhould be made manifeſt? This is a Plaiſter for thy
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:43809:240"/>Wounds, a Crown for thy Combats, a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for thy Patience.</hi> For what followed was perhaps inconſiderable, though they ſeem great Bleſſings to ſome, and deſign'd to ſatisfie the Ambition of men of narrow Souls, when he received double for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had loſt. Nor is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo very wonderful, that <hi>George</hi> the Uſurper ſhould fare better than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius.</hi> But this would have been a greater miracle, if this good and juſt man had never been tryed in this fire of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, nor is this ſo prodigious, had not his tryals been of ſo long a continuance; he went into baniſhment from this place, and ordered the affairs of his exile with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable decorum; for he confin'd himſelf to the godly Monaſteries of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> where the holy men weaning themſelves from the world, and falling in love with a deſart enjoy a more intimate familiarity with God, than thoſe, that are turmoiled with the affairs of this life; ſome turning Hermits, living remote from all Society, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing only with themſelves, and God, and claiming acquaintance with no other part of the habitable world, but their cell; others living in charitable fraternities, are both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorets, and Fryars, dead to all other men, and concernments, which in the midſt of the world both create, and ſuffer diſturbances, and by their often changings cheat, and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan us, while their Monaſtery is the world to them, in which they provoke each other to virtue by a holy emulation. With theſe
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:43809:240"/>good ſouls this great perſon converſing, as he was the great Mediator and Reconciler of all other Controverſies, imitating him that by his blood made peace, and united thoſe that were oppoſite; ſo he reconciled the ſolitary life with the ſociable, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting that the Prieſthood was a friend to true Philoſophy, and that the ſtudy of wiſdom wanted the inſpection of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. So he harmoniouſly cemented both ſorts of life, coupling a contemplative activeneſs with practical meditations, to perſwade men that a Monaſtick life doth more conſiſt in the gravity of mens man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, than the retirements of the outward man. Of which opinion was <hi>David,</hi> that man of great Employments, yet much a lover of ſolitude, if the aſſertion of his be demonſtrative and credible,

What he adviſed them became a Law, what he forbad them was execrable; his aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were like the Tables of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the reverence paid him greater than what is due to the Saints. For when ſome rude Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains hunted after this holy man, as after a wild beaſt, and could no where find him, theſe <hi>Aſceticks</hi> would not vouchſafe to ſpeak to them, but ſtretched out their necks to
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:43809:241"/>the Souldiers Swords, as if they were in jeopardy for the ſake of Chriſt, reckoning if they could ſuffer any thing for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſo good a man, that it would be of great weight to beautifie their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophick Profeſſion, and more ſublime and extraordinary, than all their faſts and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micubations, and other acts of mortification, which were their delicacies. Among theſe men did our Patriarch lead his life, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented the truth of that paſſage of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> that <hi>every thing hath its ſeaſon;</hi> for this reaſon he conceal'd himſelf for a while, as one that fled from the face of an Enemy and a furious War, that he might appear with the greater ſplendour in the ſeaſon of peace, which a little afterward happened; but the factious Pſeudo-Patriarch, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this long retirement of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> runs through all <hi>Egypt,</hi> and acted by the violences of his impious mind, makes his thieviſh Incurſions into <hi>Syria,</hi> and ravages as much of the Eaſt as was poſſible, ſetting upon the infirm and weaker brethren, the inconſiderate and the dull, as a torrent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with it all that it can ſweep away, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon the ſimplicity of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for my reverence for his ſacred Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter forbids me to call it levity, (for to ſay the truth, he was very zealous, but not according to knowledge) he next purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the favours of the Courtiers, men that loved money beyond Chriſt (for the Goods of the poor were his bank and treaſure, imployed to wicked and unlawful purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes)
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:43809:241"/>and among them the effeminate, and the Eunuchs, men that are no men, whoſe Sex is doubtful, but profligate manners moſt notorious, who being deputed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily to the overſight and cuſtody of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, it is a wonder to me how the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours ever concerned them in any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculine Employments. So prevalent was this Servant of the Devil, this Seedſman of Tares, this Harbinger of Antichriſt, employing for this purpoſe the tongue of the moſt eloquent of the Biſhops of that time (if I may ſo call him, who was not ſo much an Heretick, as an envious and ambitious man: for I ſhall willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his name) but he ſtood inſtead of the hand, and was the Leader of the Faction, ſeeking the overthrow of the truth, by the prevalence of his money, which being col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for the advancement of the intereſts of Religion, was by this evil man made an inſtrument to promote impiety.

For this ſentence <hi>(that the Son of God was like the Father according to the Scriptures)</hi> was only a bait to the weaker ſort of Chriſtians, covering the Hook of Hereſie, a Picture that lookt on all that paſt by it, a Shoe that would fit either foot, a Vanne turned with every wind, a new invented Engine to the ſupplanting of the truth, acted and ſet on motion by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: For they were wiſe to do evil, but to do good had no knowledge; hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their cunning condemnation of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, whom in their words they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd the Church, that their deſigns might look more plauſibly, but by their actions introduc'd, reproving them not for any heterodoxy in opinion, but immoderate paſſion and love of contention. Hence Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men became Judges of thoſe in holy Orders, and a new mixture happen'd, the moſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Doctrines of Religion diſputed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the multitude, and an unlawful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into Affairs, Sycophants hired, and ſentence on the premiſes denounc'd. Thus
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:43809:242"/>many Prelates were unjuſtly dethron'd, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſubſtitated, but on no other terms, but that they ſhould ſubſcribe to the <hi>Arian</hi> impiety, as they ought to all things elſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily previous to their Inſtalment; the Pen and Ink was at hand, and an Accuſer at their back; this betrayed many of the Orthodox, men otherwiſe of invincible conſtancy, who erred in their ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though their Opinions were Catholick, and gave their conſent to the proceedings of thoſe men, who on both accounts were wicked, and though they kept themſelves from falling into the fire, could not eſcape being ſullied with the ſmoak; this I have often lamented, when I obſerved how He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie diffus'd it ſelf, and the Orthodox Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was perſecuted by the great Patrons of Chriſt's Divinity; verily the Paſtors have done fooliſhly, as it is written, and have deſtroyed my Vineyard, and diſhonoured the pleaſant portion, that is, the Church of God, conſecrated with much ſweat, and many martyred ones both before and after Chriſt, and by the great ſufferings of God for us. For except a few perſons, who for their meanneſs were contemptible, or their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage lookt on as Enemies (who it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſhould be left as a root and ſeed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that by the influences of the Spirit that might flouriſh a-new and recover) all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers complyed with the time, only with this difference, that ſome were ſooner, ſome later trepan'd; ſome were Leaders and Heads of Parties in this Faction, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:43809:243"/>of an inferiour rank, who either were betrayed by their fear, or captivated by covetouſneſs, or allured by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or impoſed on by ignorance, which was the moſt modeſt plea. If that may ſeem to be ſufficient to apologize for ſuch men, who take on them the Inſtruction and Government of the people. For as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Lions and other Beaſts, of men and women, of old and young men are not the ſame, but there is no ſmall difference in Ages and Sexes; ſo neither are the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the ſame of Rulers and their Subjects; for the <hi>vulgus</hi> that ſo complyed are to be pardoned, who are indiſpos'd to curioſity, but how ſhall we concede ſuch failures to their Teachers, who, unleſs they uſurp that name, ought to correct and illuminate the ignorance of their Followers? For if not the moſt illiterate and ruſtick perſon can ſafely be ignorant of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, nor is there any excuſe allowed for them that tranſgreſs through want of knowledge, is it not an abſurd thing, that the Teachers of the Laws of Heaven ſhould be ignorant of the Principles of Salvation, although in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things they may be allowed to have leſs skill and inſight? But grant it that they ſhall be pardoned that erre for want of knowledge, what ſhall we ſay of others, who laying claim to wit and <hi>acumen,</hi> yet for the cauſes formerly mentioned, have ſubmitted to thoſe Hereticks that had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpt a power; and whereas for a while they were the Mask of Piety, as ſoon as
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:43809:243"/>there appeared any thing of reprehenſion, eaſily laid it aſide? I hear the Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that heaven and earth ſhall yet once be ſhaken, as if they had ſuffered thoſe tremblings before, intimating ſome nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble change and alteration of things; and we muſt believe S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that the laſt and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal earthquake ſhall be no other, but the ſecond coming of Chriſt, the mutation of the univerſe, and tranſlation of it into that which defies change, and motion. But I ſuppoſe the Earthquake, that in this age broke forth, was not leſs furious, than any of the former, by reaſon of which all the lovers of God, and Religion, and thoſe who before this time had their converſation wholly in heaven, were ſhaken, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in every other thing they are mild, and peaceable, now could not endure to be moderate, and to betray the cauſe of God by their ſilence, but in this caſe are egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous combatants, and lovers of contention (for ſuch is the heat of Zeal) and ready ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to over-do ſome things, than leave any thing material undone, by the ſame violence no ſmall part of the people were diſtracted, as in a flock of birds taking their flight with thoſe in the front, and not yet ceaſing to employ their wings.</p>
                           <p>'Such a comfort was <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to us, as long as that Pillar of the Church continued among us, and ſo great a cauſe of ſorrow, when the Contrivances of vile men forc'd him hence: For as thoſe that deſign to ſtorm a ſtrong Caſtle, when they find the place o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:43809:244"/>unapproachable and hard to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, make uſe of cunning where ſtrength fails, alluring the Governour with Money, or ſome other piece of ſubtilty, and ſo with eaſe maſter the Cittadel; or if you will, as they, that did lye in wait for <hi>Sampſon,</hi> firſt cut off his Hair, in which his ſtrength lay, and then took Priſoner that Judge of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſporting with him as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in requital of the effects of his former courage: So did our Philiſtims, having laid Chains on the ſtrength, and cut off the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Church, wallow in the pleaſures of their impious Opinions and Actions. At this time <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the great Patron and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of the <hi>Pſeudo-Patriarch,</hi> dyes, putting an evil end to his Raign that was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evil, and to no purpoſe repenting, as it is reported, when he drew his laſt breath, (for then every man is an exact Judge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by reaſon of the Tribunal he is going before): he is ſaid to have been ſorry for three things, that did misbecome his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, the murther of his Relations, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the Apoſtate his Succeſſor, and the countenancing Novelties of Faith, and with theſe words it is ſaid that he exſpired his laſt breath. After which the truth reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered its loſt Authority, and thoſe that were its Confeſſors their liberty, their Zeal giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an edge to their Indignation; this alſo happened to the people of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (as an inraged populace uſes to be tranſported againſt their Injurers) who not being able to ſuffer the immoderate Extravagancies of
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:43809:244"/>the Uſurper, for this reaſon publickly expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated his Villanies by a ſtrange death, and a new method of Revenge. Ye well remember the Camel on which he was laid, and its new faſhion'd burthen odly exalted, together with the firſt, and I think the only proceſſion which it went, a way of revenge at this day threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to injurious perſons. But after this whirl-wind of Injuſtice, this Corrupter of Piety, this Fore-runner of the Devil was thus ſlain, though unjuſtly (for we ought to conſider, not what he deſerved to ſuffer, but what we ſhould do, but he was puniſh'd, and became the Object of the Epidemick fury) this generous Champion return'd from his famous Exile (for ſo I muſt call his flight for and with the Trinity) and finds the Citizens ſo chearful and joyed at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and in truth all <hi>Aegypt</hi> gathered into that one place, that ſome were ſatisfyed only with ſeeing <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> others with hearing his Voice, others (as it was ſaid of the Apoſtles) were ſanctifyed with his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow only, and this new Image of him; ſo that whereas many heretofore both Princes and Prieſts, and other eminent men, have been met with much honour, yet no man with more ſplendor and a greater Company than <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and only the Prelate, and his former return from a like flight, and for a like cauſe can parallel it; for ſo the report runs of that Parade, for I will relate it, though it ſeem ſuperfluous, that it may give a guſto, and reliſh, and additional beauty to my Panegyrick. After this return of the
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:43809:245"/>Patriarch, one of the State-Officers made his Entry (he was my Countryman, a <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> a man of eminent Birth, and I preſume you know that I mean <hi>Philagrius</hi>) the love of the Citizens towards him was without compariſon, and the honour they did him proportionable to their love for him (that I may ſay all in a few words) on whom the command of the City was a ſecond time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by the concurrent ſuffrage of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrians,</hi> and the choice of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; at that time one of the populace ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the infinite multitudes of people, as if it had been a vaſt Sea of men, is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus to have accoſted one of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as is uſual on ſuch occaſions; Tell me, my beſt friend, didſt ever ſee ſuch a vaſt quantity of people, and ſo unanimous, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together for the honour of one man? By no means, ſaid the young man, I do not believe that the Emperour <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was received with ſo much ſtate; as if he thought nothing could be mentioned higher than that; to whom the other ſmilingly, Doſt thou reckon that as a great and wonderful thing? I can hardly believe that the great <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was ſo received, and preſently he ſubjoyns an Oath to confirm it. His diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe tending, as it ſeems plain to me, to prefer this celebrated man to the Emperour: So great was the veneration which all men paid him, and with ſuch wonder do men ſtill make reflections on his Reſtauration. For the whole City like a large River went out to meet him, (as the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:43809:245"/>when they deſign to honour any perſon. And how ſhall I relate the pomp of this Spectacle? a Poet would ſay, that <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> that golden ſtream'd and fertile River run backward from the City to <hi>Chaereum,</hi> by the ſpace of a days Journey, and more. Give me leave therefore to indulge and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace my ſelf with the Narration; for I am bent upon it, nor is it eaſie to divert my Speech to any other Object from this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. He rid on a Colt, (pardon the boldneſs of the Compariſon) as my Jeſus entred <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> riding on the Foal of an Aſs: whether we ſhall underſtand by it the Gentile World on which he aſcended having delivered it from the Chains of Ignorance, or any other thing be intimated in that Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. There was only this difference, that the Boughs and the various and exquiſite Garments were ſpread in the way of Chriſt, but no ſuch preparation was made for this ſublime and precious Prelate, who in that one particular was leſs honour'd than his Maſter. This his return to the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was an exact picture of Chriſt's entry into the holy City; in that many went before him and ſhouted and leap'd for joy; not only a Troop of Children that ſang his Encomia, but the Tongues of both his Friends and Enemies ſtrove to out-do one another in his praiſe. I omit the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick applauſe, and the profuſe Expences of Unguents and Perfumes, the multitude of Torches that ſhed their luſtre on the whole City, the publick and private Banquets,

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:43809:246"/>the great fomenters of his ſorrows, that his reſtoration was not unacceptable even to them. He purges the Temple by driving out all Sacrilegious Abuſers of Religion, that proſtituted the name of God, and Chriſt to their profit, that in this alſo he might imitate his Saviour; only he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the whip of Cords, and ſubſtituted in the place thereof Perſwaſives and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. He cements all breaches among thoſe that were at enmity with him, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, needing no other aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces but his own; he delivers the afflicted from Tyranny, making no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them of his own and the adverſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He lifts out of the duſt, and reſtores to its honour the truth that had been tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on, and now the Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is boldly aſſerted, and the light is ſet on a Candleſtick, that by the bright rays of the Unity of the Godhead, it might illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate all mens Souls: now he again makes Laws for the World, and enclines all mens minds to himſelf, writing to ſome, calling others, and inſtructing a third ſort that were never ſent for, obliging no man to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reſtraint, but to be willing; for this one thing was ſufficient to direct them to the Paths of Virtue. In ſhort, he imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the qualities of two famous ſtones; to thoſe that abuſed him he was an Adamant, to the contentious and quarrelſome a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which by a miraculous quality draws Iron the hardeſt of things to its ſelf; but it was impoſſible that envy ſhould endure
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:43809:247"/>this, or ſuffer tamely the reſtitution of the Church to her priſtine beauty and health, the diſſenting Members thereof being reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, as the Wounds of a Body that hath been mangled are cloſed up again. To this end the Father of malice incenſed againſt him the Emperour, who was the Fiend's Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Apoſtate, who (though his <hi>junior</hi> in time, was his equal in miſchief, the firſt of all Chriſtian Princes that was inraged againſt Chriſt, ſuddenly introducing that wicked Cockatrice, which long before had been brought forth and cheriſh'd by him, as ſoon as a fit opportunity offered, and he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the Empire) became ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to that Soveraign that intruſted him with the <hi>Regalia,</hi> and abundantly more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious againſt God his Saviour, and begins a perſecution more fatal than all that had preceeded it, intermixing perſwaſives with his threats, (for he envyed the Martyrs the honour of their ſufferings) called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Trophies of their courage, uſing all ſort of Sophiſtry and little arts in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and allowing them to ſuperintend his manners, or to ſpeak a plainer truth, being inclined by his own perverſe habit of mind to ſuch Villanies, imitating the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and artifice of that Demon that poſſeſt him; he accounted it but a poor Conqueſt to triumph over the whole Family of Chriſt, but look'd on the ſubduing <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and ſtifling his undertakings in the behalf of the truth, as a great Victory; for he ſaw that none of his Deſigns againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:43809:247"/>were crowned with ſucceſs, as long as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> oppoſed him, for the places of as many as deſerted Religion were ſupplyed by his prudence with new Gentile Proſelytes, which was very miraculous. Which when that crafty Impoſtor and Perſecutor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, he no longer keeps on his Maſque of ſervile diſſimulation, but making publick his rancor, openly expels this great man the City; for it became this generous Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to be thrice Victorious, that his rewards might be perfect; a ſmall time after the Divine Juſtice hurryed this ſacrilegious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and there puniſh'd him; and having permitted him to go forth, a Prince eagerly ambitious of renown, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd him dead without the leaſt ſign of pity or ſorrow; and, as I have heard, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the honour of Sepulture, his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toſs'd up and down by the fury of an Earthquake, that then happened as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for his Crimes, the Prologue, as I ſuppoſe, to his future Tragedy; but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Emperour ſucceeds him of a modeſt Countenance, and a ſtranger to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates Impudence, one that never oppreſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> by his own or his Followers evil Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but was incomparably pious and mild, who, that he might ſettle his Empire on the beſt Foundation, and begin his Raign with the eſtabliſhing excellent Laws, recalls all the baniſh'd Prelates, and above all him, that out-ſhone them in Virtue, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly was a Sufferer for Godlineſs; he enquires after the true and Orthodox Faith,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:43809:248"/>that had been by many torn in pieces and mangled, and diſtracted into many novel Opinions, that if it were poſſible the whole World might be united in the ſame harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious profeſſion, by the cooperation of the holy ſpirit; if not, he might joyn himſelf to the Catholick Party, and reciprocally give it aſſiſtance, and receive help from it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining himſelf with high and exceeding venerable thoughts of ſuch Myſteries. And here did this Sage-man give a Specimen of his purity and conſtancy in the Faith of Chriſt; for whereas other Profeſſors were divided into three ſeveral Factions, many being Unorthodox in their Sentiments of the Son of God, and more in their Opinions of the holy Ghoſt (where to be a puny Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor was accounted a mark of Piety) and only a few were in every thing ſound Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, he chiefly, and alone, or with a few Followers openly and in the Face of the World is a confident Aſſertor of the truth, confeſſing in his Writings the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Eſſence of the three perſons, and in that God head which in times paſt was by the many Fathers adjuſted to the Son, was the holy ſpirit reinveſted by this inſpired Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, who tendred a truly royal and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent preſent to the Emperour, an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Creed in oppoſition to the Heretical Novelties that had no baſis in Scripture, that one Emperour might countermine another, one Doctrine invalidate another, one Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuperſede another; to this Confeſſion of Faith both the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> ſeem to me to pay a ſubmiſſive deference

But I will add one thing to my former Relation, which I above all things revere in him, and which I cannot without injuring you paſs by, at this time eſpecially, which is a time of Schiſms and Contentions; for this action of his ought to be an inſtruction to us, that now
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:43809:249"/>are alive, if we ſeriouſly weigh it; for as when one thruſts his hand into the water, he not only ſeparates between the water that is left, but between what he graſps in his hands, and runs between his fingers: So we divide not only from all impiety, but from the eminently godly, not in ſmall, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, and contemptible opinions, (for this were more tolerable) but in words, that tend to one, and the ſame ſenſe; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we piouſly aſſert one eſſence, and three hypoſtaſes, the one deſcribing the nature of the Godhead, the other the properties of the Trinity, (as alſo do the <hi>Italians,</hi> only by reaſon of the barrenneſs of their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage not able to diſtinguiſh the hypoſtaſis from the eſſence, leſt they might ſeem to admit three ſubſtances, they ſubſtitute in the name of three hypoſtaſes three perſons) what happened? ſomething very ridiculous, or rather lamentable. This little difference in words made a noiſe as if there had been difference in opinion; hence the Hereſie of <hi>Sabellius</hi> took its riſe becauſe of the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the three perſons, and <hi>Arianiſme</hi> becauſe of the three hypoſtaſes, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rude off-ſpring of a pertinacious love of contention. And what ſucceeded? this ſmall diſtinction being eſtabliſh'd, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on ſome mens minds, (and what made it diſtaſteful was a love of quarelling) the ends of the earth were in danger to be ruin'd by a few ſyllables; which when this bleſs'd Saint, this true man of God, and great guide of ſouls both ſaw, and heard, he
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:43809:249"/>could not endure to ſlight and neglect ſo abſurd and unreaſonable a diſtinction, but applyed a remedy to the diſtemper; and how did he make his application? having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened both parties with all meekneſs and humility, and accurately weighed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the words, after he found them agreeing in the things themſelves, and not in the leaſt differing in matters of doctrine, allowing them the variety of names, he ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to unity of ſentiments; this was a more advantagious act of charity to the Church, than all his other daily labours and diſcourſes, which all men celebrate, in which there may be intermixt ſome love of applauſe, and for that reaſon ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation made in the Faith. This was more honorable, than all his watchings, and humicubations, the benefits of which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the particular practiſers of thoſe virtues; nay it is nothing inferior to his applauded flights, and exiles; for after his ſufferings he purſued thoſe things, for which he choſe to undertake ſuch calamities; and this alſo was his deſign on others, praiſing ſome, moderately correcting others, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpur to ſome dull tempers, and the reins to other hot ſpirits, infinitely careful, that the offenders might repent, and thoſe that were innocent might be kept from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; in his converſation maſter of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſimplicity, in his government of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt variety of skill, wiſe in his diſcourſes, but much wiſer in his intellect, to the mean ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities he ſtoop'd himſelf, to the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

               <hi>Antoninus</hi> we are entertain'd with a pleaſant ſtory of an Imaginary Council at <hi>Rome</hi> under a Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> that never was, which he that liſt, may read at large in that Hiſtorian. Who having recited the particulars out of <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his <hi>Speculum,</hi> and <hi>Jacobus de Voragine,</hi> acknowledges them to be dubious, and are indeed no way reconcileable to truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we create an Antipope at that time, called <hi>Leo,</hi> or aſſert, that Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> had two names, whereof one was <hi>Leo,</hi> both which are equally improbable; for there is not a word to this purpoſe in the antient Church-Hiſtorians, who are ſo copious in their accounts of the <hi>Arian</hi> Synods, no not in <hi>Philoſtorgius</hi> their own Hiſtorian, who not caring to falſifie the Records of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, would certainly never have ſtifled ſo remarkable a tranſaction, had there been but the leaſt ſhadow of truth to countenance it.</p>

Nor is Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s ſuperſtructure on this fiction any firmer, than its foundation, that S. <hi>Hilary</hi> was not <hi>Gallus,</hi> but <hi>de Gallia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe born in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> which Country, ſays <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> was diſtinct from that part of <hi>France,</hi> which was properly called <hi>Gallia,</hi> or <hi>Gallia Celtica,</hi> as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> affirms, but in truth wrongly; for the Province of <hi>Poictou</hi> in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſars</hi> account was a part of <hi>Gallia pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè dicta,</hi> which being inhabited by the <hi>Celtae,</hi> was divided from <hi>Aquitain</hi> by the River <hi>la Garonne,</hi> and from the <hi>Belgae</hi> by the <hi>Seine,</hi> and <hi>la Marne.</hi> For <hi>France</hi> having been divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the <hi>Aſiatick,</hi> which is <hi>Galatia,</hi> and the <hi>European,</hi> and this laſt into <hi>Ciſpadana,</hi> called <hi>Gallia Togata,</hi> and <hi>Tranſpadana,</hi> the later was divided into <hi>Gallia Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chata,</hi> or <hi>Narbonenſis</hi> and <hi>Comata;</hi> this <hi>Gallia Comata</hi> was by <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> firſt among the <hi>Latines</hi> divided into <hi>Gallia Celtica</hi> [called afterwards <hi>Lugdunenſis</hi>] <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanica,</hi>
